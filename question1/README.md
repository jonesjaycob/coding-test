# Objective

This project aims to implement a straightforward search and autocomplete functionality. It's designed to dynamically filter and display results from a predefined list located within `./src/library` based on user input. The goal is to ensure that as users type their query, the system intelligently filters the list, presenting matched terms in an effective and intuitive manner.

# Resources

1. You may use any tool necessary to complete this feature. (ex Google, Stackoverflow, etc.)
2. A LLM is not allowed (ex ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the (official Node.js website)[https://nodejs.org/en].
- npm (Node Package Manager) is installed. npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

# Installation Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

# Starting the Project

Once the installation is complete, you can start the project with the following steps:

1. In your terminal or command prompt, ensure you are still in the project's root directory.
2. Execute the command `npm start`. This will launch the project and a local development server.
3. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

The application should now be running, and you can interact with the search and autocomplete feature as intended. Enjoy exploring the functionality and best of luck with your coding endeavors!
